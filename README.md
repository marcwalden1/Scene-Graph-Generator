# Scene Graph Generator

### Description
This project is a reimplementation of the Scene Graph Generation Benchmark based on [Kaihua Tang's Scene-Graph-Benchmark repository](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch/blob/master/README.md). It is introduced in the paper [Unbiased Scene Graph Generation from Biased Training](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Tang_Unbiased_Scene_Graph_Generation_From_Biased_Training_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) Scene graph generation aims to predict objects and the relationships between them (subject-predicate-object) from an input image. It is a crucial task in computer vision, facilitating higher-level understanding of visual scenes and enabling downstream applications like image captioning, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation.


### Objectives
- To explore and implement a scene graph generator capable of:
    - Assigning labels to objects in images.
    - Drawing bounding boxes around detected objects.
    - Predicting relationships between object pairs (e.g., dog-chasing-ball).
- To gain research experience in computer vision and contribute to foundational work in scene understanding.
- To demonstrate the utility of the Scene Graph Generation model for visual scene analysis using a pre-trained architecture.
- To provide clear examples of input-output visualizations, making this repository a useful reference for academic and research purposes.
